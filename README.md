Discovering some famous Quantum Algorithms!!!!!

<h1>VQE -> Variational Quantum Eigensolver</h1>  
<br>  
=> An algorithm for quantum chemistry using quantum computers.   
=> VQE is an application of the Ritz variational principle.   
=> In  Ritz variational principle a  quantum computer is used to prepare a wave function ansatz of the molecule  
   and estimate the expectation value of its electronic Hamiltonian while a classical optimizer is used to adjust  
   the quantum circuit parameters in order to find the moleculeâ€™s ground state energy.
